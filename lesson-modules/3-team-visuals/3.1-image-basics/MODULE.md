# Module 3.1: Image Generation Basics

**Duration:** 20 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Level 2 completed

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:
1. Understand how DALL-E 3 image generation works
2. Write effective image prompts
3. Iterate and refine image outputs
4. Know the types of images useful for SM work
5. Understand limitations and best practices

---

## Why Visuals Matter for SMs

Visual communication is powerful for:
- Sprint reviews (engaging stakeholders)
- Retrospective facilitation (creative formats)
- Team celebrations (milestone graphics)
- Process documentation (diagrams, flows)
- Presentations (professional polish)

Copilot can generate images using DALL-E 3, making professional visuals accessible without design skills.

## How DALL-E 3 Works

When you ask Copilot to create an image, it uses DALL-E 3 to generate visuals from text descriptions.

### What It Can Create

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Illustrations** | Team celebrations, concept visuals |
| **Diagrams** | Processes, flows (limited) |
| **Icons/Graphics** | Sprint badges, achievement symbols |
| **Scenes** | Meeting rooms, collaboration visuals |
| **Abstract** | Data visualizations, mood graphics |

### What It Can't Create

- Exact diagrams with specific text labels (use drawing tools)
- Photos of real people
- Copyrighted characters or logos
- Very precise technical diagrams

---

## Writing Effective Image Prompts

Good image prompts are:
- **Specific:** Describe what you want to see
- **Styled:** Indicate art style or aesthetic
- **Compositional:** Describe layout, perspective
- **Emotional:** Indicate mood or feeling

### Prompt Structure

```
Create an image of [subject]
Style: [art style - flat design, illustration, isometric, etc.]
Mood: [feeling - celebratory, professional, calm, energetic]
Colors: [palette or brand colors if relevant]
Composition: [layout, perspective, framing]
```

---

## Exercise 1: Basic Image Generation

Let's create a simple celebration image.

**Try this prompt:**

```
Create an image celebrating a successful sprint completion.

Subject: A diverse team of 7 people celebrating together
Setting: Modern office with screens showing green metrics
Style: Clean, modern illustration with flat design elements
Mood: Celebratory, energetic, positive
Colors: Blue (#2563EB) and purple (#7C3AED) as primary
Include: Confetti, high-fives, smiling faces

Perspective: Eye-level, team in center frame
```

### What You Should See

An illustrated scene of a team celebrating with visual elements that convey success.

**Note:** Results vary. DALL-E interprets prompts creatively.

---

## Exercise 2: Iterate and Refine

Images rarely come out perfect on the first try. Iteration is key.

**After generating an image, try these refinements:**

```
Make the same image but:
- More diverse team members
- Add a dashboard or screen showing metrics
- More prominent confetti
- Brighter, more saturated colors
```

Or:

```
Keep the concept but change the style to:
- Minimalist line art
- Isometric 3D illustration
- Watercolor style
- Corporate presentation style
```

### Iteration Tips

1. **Be specific about changes** - "More X" or "Less Y"
2. **Reference what you liked** - "Keep the composition but change..."
3. **Try different styles** - Same concept, different aesthetic
4. **Save good ones** - You can't exactly recreate an image

---

## Exercise 3: Professional Styles

For SM work, certain styles work better than others.

**Try these style variations:**

**For Sprint Reviews (professional):**
```
Create a professional presentation-style graphic showing team progress.
Style: Corporate, clean, minimal
Colors: Professional blue palette
Include: An upward-trending graph, milestone markers
Mood: Confident, progressive
```

**For Retrospectives (engaging):**
```
Create a visual for a "Sailboat" retrospective format.
Show: A sailboat with wind (helps), anchor (slows), rocks (risks), island (goals)
Style: Friendly illustration, clean and colorful
Mood: Inviting, creative, collaborative
Perspective: Side view of the sailboat scene
```

**For Team Celebrations (fun):**
```
Create a badge for "Sprint 47 Complete!"
Style: Achievement badge or medal design
Colors: Gold and blue
Include: Number 47, stars, laurel wreath
Mood: Celebratory, accomplishment
Format: Circular badge design
```

## Understanding Limitations

### What DALL-E Does Well

✅ Illustrations and artistic interpretations
✅ Mood and atmosphere
✅ Diverse representation (when prompted)
✅ Creative concepts
✅ Multiple style options

### What DALL-E Struggles With

⚠️ Precise text in images (often garbled)
⚠️ Exact diagrams with connections
⚠️ Specific number of elements (may add/remove)
⚠️ Copying a specific style exactly
⚠️ Hands and fingers (getting better, still imperfect)

### Workarounds

- **For text:** Add text in PowerPoint/Canva after generating
- **For diagrams:** Use diagram tools, generate conceptual illustrations
- **For precision:** Generate inspiration, refine in design tools

## Exercise 4: SM-Relevant Image Types

Let's generate images relevant to Scrum Master work.

**Try each of these:**

**1. Sprint Goal Visual:**
```
Create an image representing the sprint goal:
"Deliver notification system MVP"

Show: Notification icons, mobile devices, flowing information
Style: Tech illustration, modern flat design
Colors: Blue and white with accent colors
Mood: Forward-moving, connected, efficient
```

**2. Team Values Poster:**
```
Create an image representing agile team values:
- Collaboration
- Transparency
- Continuous improvement

Style: Modern, inspirational poster design
Include: People working together, lightbulb/growth symbols
Colors: Warm, inviting palette
Mood: Inspiring, united, positive
```

**3. Ceremony Illustration:**
```
Create an image of a diverse team in a sprint retrospective.
Setting: Modern meeting room with sticky notes on walls
Style: Warm, inclusive illustration
Show: 7 people engaged in discussion, some remote on screen
Mood: Collaborative, reflective, constructive
```

## Credits and Usage

DALL-E 3 in Copilot may have usage limits:
- Enterprise licenses typically have generous limits
- High-resolution images may use more credits
- Check with your admin about usage policies

### Saving and Using Images

1. **Right-click and save** generated images
2. **Use in presentations** - PowerPoint, Google Slides
3. **Add to documents** - Word, Confluence
4. **Share in Teams** - Sprint celebrations, announcements
