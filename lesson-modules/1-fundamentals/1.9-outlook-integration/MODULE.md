## Adjusting Tone

Copilot can rewrite emails for different tones.

### Exercise 2: Tone Adjustment

Make this email shorter. Keep the key points but cut it to 3 sentences.
```

**Make it more formal:**
```
Rewrite this email in a more formal tone suitable for a C-level executive.
```

**Make it friendlier:**
```
Adjust the tone to be warmer and more conversational while staying professional.
```

**Add urgency:**
```
Rewrite to convey more urgency about the design capacity issue
without being alarmist.
```

## Escalation Emails

Escalations require the right balance of urgency, data, and professionalism.

- Average resolution time: 5.3 days
- 3 stories carried over due to design dependencies

```

- Team members: Raj, Lisa, Marcus, Priya (IST), James, Emma, David
- Need 1.5 hours
- Priya's core hours are 10am-3pm ET (her evening)

Find a time slot that works for everyone, ideally Tuesday after the review.
