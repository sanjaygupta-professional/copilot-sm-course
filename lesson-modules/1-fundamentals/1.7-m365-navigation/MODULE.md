**Duration:** 15 minutes
**Prerequisites:** Module 1.6 completed

---

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:
1. Use Copilot in Word for sprint documentation
2. Use Copilot in Excel for metrics tracking
3. Use Copilot in PowerPoint for sprint reviews
4. Know when to use chat vs. in-app Copilot
5. Navigate seamlessly between Copilot surfaces

## Chat vs. In-App Copilot

There are two ways to use Copilot:

| Surface | Best For | How to Access |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Copilot Chat** | Open-ended analysis, research, multi-file work | Browser, Alt+Spacebar |
| **In-App Copilot** | Working within a specific document | Alt+I within the app |

For Scrum Masters:
- **Chat** for synthesizing notes, research, planning
- **In-App** for creating documents, analyzing spreadsheets, building presentations

---

## Copilot in Word

Word Copilot helps you create, edit, and enhance documents.

### SM Use Cases in Word

- Sprint review summary documents
- Definition of Ready/Done documentation
- Retrospective summary reports
- Stakeholder communication documents

### Exercise 1: Generate Sprint Summary

**Do this now:**

1. Open a new Word document
2. Press **Alt + I** to open Copilot
3. Use this prompt:

```
Create a Sprint 47 Summary document with the following sections:

SPRINT OVERVIEW:
- Sprint: 47 (Oct 16-29, 2025)
- Team: Velocity Squad (7 members)
- Committed: 52 points
- Completed: 42 points
- Carryover: 10 points

DELIVERED VALUE:
- Notification system MVP (preferences, email, in-app)
- Search optimization (45% faster)
- API rate limiting
- Caching layer

WHAT CARRIED OVER:
- Push notifications (8 points) - more complex than estimated
- Dashboard loading improvement (3 points) - stretch goal

KEY METRICS:
- Velocity: 42 (average: 45)
- Sprint goal: Partially achieved

LESSONS LEARNED:
- Push notification complexity underestimated
- Design dependency continues to be an issue

Format with professional headings and bullet points.
```

4. Review the generated document
5. Use "Rewrite" or "Adjust tone" to refine

### What You Should See

A professional document that you can share with stakeholders or file for team records.

## Copilot in Excel

Excel Copilot helps you analyze data, create formulas, and visualize metrics.

### SM Use Cases in Excel

- Velocity tracking and trends
- Burndown chart creation
- Team health survey analysis
- Capacity planning calculations

### Exercise 2: Analyze Velocity Data

**Do this now:**

1. Open Excel
2. Create or open a spreadsheet with velocity data:

| Sprint | Committed | Completed | Carryover |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 40 | 50 | 48 | 2 |
| 41 | 52 | 52 | 0 |
| 42 | 40 | 35 | 5 |
| 43 | 55 | 55 | 0 |
| 44 | 50 | 42 | 8 |
| 45 | 48 | 38 | 10 |
| 46 | 50 | 45 | 5 |
| 47 | 52 | 42 | 10 |

3. Press **Alt + I** to open Copilot
4. Ask:

```
Analyze this velocity data and:
1. Calculate average completed velocity
2. Calculate standard deviation
3. Show the trend (improving, declining, stable)
4. Create a line chart comparing committed vs completed
5. Highlight sprints where carryover exceeded 5 points
```

### What You Should See

Copilot will:
- Calculate statistics (avg ~45, std dev ~7)
- Create visualizations
- Add conditional formatting
- Provide analysis insights

## Copilot in PowerPoint

PowerPoint Copilot helps you create presentations from scratch or enhance existing ones.

### SM Use Cases in PowerPoint

- Sprint review presentations
- Retrospective facilitation slides
- Team health reports for leadership
- Agile training materials

### Exercise 3: Create Sprint Review Deck

**Do this now:**

1. Open PowerPoint
2. Press **Alt + I** to open Copilot
3. Use this prompt:

```
Create a 5-slide Sprint Review presentation for Sprint 47.

SLIDE 1: Title
- "Sprint 47 Review - Velocity Squad"
- Date: October 29, 2025

SLIDE 2: Sprint Goal & Metrics
- Goal: Deliver notification system phase 2 and improve API performance
- Committed: 52 points | Completed: 42 points
- Sprint Goal: Partially Achieved

SLIDE 3: What We Delivered
- Notification system MVP (preferences, email, in-app UI)
- Search optimization - 45% performance improvement
- API rate limiting
- Caching layer
Include icons or visuals for each item

SLIDE 4: What's Carrying Over
- Push notifications (8 points) - more complex than estimated
- Will be priority for Sprint 48

SLIDE 5: Key Wins & Learnings
- Win: Search 45% faster - major user impact
- Win: Notification foundation complete
- Learning: Better estimation needed for new technology
- Learning: Continue working on design dependency

Use a professional blue color scheme. Keep text concise.
```

4. Review the generated presentation
5. Use "Add a slide" or "Redesign" to refine

### What You Should See

A ready-to-present deck that you can customize for your actual sprint review.

## Navigating Between Surfaces

A typical SM workflow might span multiple apps:

1. **Chat:** Synthesize raw retro notes into themes
2. **Word:** Create a retrospective summary document
3. **Excel:** Track action item completion rates
4. **PowerPoint:** Create improvement initiative presentation

### Pro Tips

- **Copy outputs:** You can copy Copilot Chat outputs into documents
- **Reference files:** In-app Copilot can reference other M365 files
- **Iterate:** Use Chat for brainstorming, then in-app for final output
