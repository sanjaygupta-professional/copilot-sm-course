## Introduction

Welcome to the Microsoft Copilot Scrum Master Course!

You're about to learn how to use Microsoft Copilot - an AI assistant that can save you **4-5 hours per week** as a Scrum Master. Unlike traditional tools, Copilot integrates directly into the Microsoft 365 apps you already use: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams.

Throughout this course, you'll work as the **Scrum Master for the Velocity Squad** at Accenture - a team building internal products for 700,000+ employees. This is a real (fictional) role with real challenges: velocity inconsistency, retrospective fatigue, remote team inclusion, and more.

**What makes this course different:** All the sample files, ceremony notes, and team context are already created for you. You're stepping into an active role with real challenges to solve!

Let's try your first Copilot interaction with Scrum Master context.

**Do this now:**

1. In Copilot chat, type the following prompt:

```
I'm a Scrum Master for a 7-person team at Accenture. We build internal
knowledge management tools. The team runs 2-week sprints.

I've been with this team for 3 months and I've noticed some challenges:
- Velocity swings wildly (35-55 points per sprint)
- Retrospectives feel stale - same issues come up repeatedly
- Our standups run 25 minutes instead of 15
- One team member is remote and feels excluded from decisions

As an experienced agile coach, what are the 3 most impactful things
I should focus on first? Explain your reasoning.
```

2. Read Copilot's response
3. Notice how Copilot gives you thoughtful, SM-relevant suggestions

**Congratulations!** You just had your first Scrum Master conversation with Copilot!
