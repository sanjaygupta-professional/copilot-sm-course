## Why Teams Copilot Matters for SMs

As a Scrum Master, you spend significant time in Teams:
- Facilitating ceremonies (planning, standups, reviews, retros)
- Communicating in team channels
- Following up on action items
- Catching up on discussions you missed

Teams Copilot transforms all of this by:
- Automatically summarizing meetings
- Extracting action items
- Answering questions about past discussions
- Catching you up when you were absent

---

## Meeting Intelligence

When Copilot is enabled for Teams meetings, it can:

| Capability | What It Does |
|------------|--------------|
| **Meeting Recap** | Summary of what was discussed |
| **Action Items** | Who committed to what |
| **Key Decisions** | Decisions that were made |
| **Follow-ups** | Things mentioned needing follow-up |
| **Participant Insights** | Who spoke, sentiment |

### Enabling Meeting Intelligence

For meeting transcription and Copilot summaries:

1. Start or join a Teams meeting
2. Click "More" (...) in the meeting controls
3. Select "Record and transcribe"
4. Copilot will process the transcript

**Note:** Recording must be enabled by your admin and disclosed to participants.

---

## Exercise 1: Sprint Planning Summary

After a sprint planning meeting with Copilot recording enabled:

**Try this prompt in the meeting chat or Copilot:**

```
Summarize this sprint planning meeting:

1. What was the sprint goal agreed upon?
2. What stories were committed to?
3. What was the total point commitment?
4. Were there any concerns raised by the team?
5. What dependencies were identified?
6. What risks were flagged?

Format as a summary I can share with the team.
```

### What You Should Get

A structured summary including:
- Sprint 48 Goal: [from discussion]
- Stories committed: [list with points]
- Total commitment: [X points]
- Team concerns: [any hesitations mentioned]
- Key dependencies: [cross-team needs]

---

## Exercise 2: Catch Up on Missed Standup

When you miss a standup (or any meeting), Copilot can catch you up.

**Open the meeting recap and ask:**

```
I missed today's standup. Catch me up:

1. Were there any blockers mentioned?
2. Did anyone need help with anything?
3. Were there any surprises or concerns?
4. What should I follow up on as the SM?

Be concise - just the highlights.
```

### What You Should Get

A quick summary of:
- Blockers that need attention
- Anyone who seemed stuck
- Any discussions that went off-track
- SM action items

---

## Exercise 3: Retrospective Action Items

After a retrospective, extracting clear action items is critical.

**Ask Copilot about the retro meeting:**

```
Extract all action items from this retrospective:

For each action item:
- What was committed to?
- Who is responsible?
- By when (if mentioned)?
- Which improvement theme does it address?

Also note:
- Which issues got the most votes/discussion?
- Were there emotional moments to follow up on?
- Any items that have come up in previous retros?

Format as a checklist I can track.
```

### What You Should Get

A structured action list:
```
☐ Focus Fridays proposal - SM - Submit to Jennifer by Friday
☐ Tech debt tracking - James - Create tracking method by next sprint
☐ Async decision log - Priya - Template by EOW
☐ Planning timebox - SM - Enforce 2-hour limit next planning
```

## Copilot in Team Channels

Beyond meetings, Copilot can help with channel conversations.

### Use Cases

- Catch up on discussions that happened while you were in meetings
- Find decisions that were made in the channel
- Search for past conversations on specific topics
- Understand the context of ongoing discussions

### Exercise 4: Channel Intelligence

In your team's channel, try these prompts:

**Catch-Up:**
```
What important discussions happened in this channel in the past week?
Highlight any decisions made, action items assigned, or issues raised.
```

**Decision Search:**
```
Were there any decisions made in this channel about
[sprint scope / technical approach / meeting times]?
```

**Topic Search:**
```
What has the team discussed about [design dependencies / velocity / testing]?
Summarize the key points and any conclusions.
```

## Pro Tips for Teams Copilot

### For Better Meeting Summaries

1. **Use clear agenda items** - Structure helps Copilot understand what was discussed
2. **Speak clearly** - Transcription quality affects summary quality
3. **Name action items explicitly** - "I'll do X by Y" gets captured better
4. **Recap decisions** - "So we've decided to..." helps Copilot identify decisions

### For Better Channel Intelligence

1. **Use clear thread subjects** - Makes searching easier
2. **Mark important messages** - Helps Copilot identify priorities
3. **Close loops** - "This is resolved" or "Decision: X" helps tracking

### SM-Specific Prompts

**After any ceremony:**
```
What were the key outcomes of this meeting for the team?
```

**For action tracking:**
```
What did [team member name] commit to in this meeting?
```

**For retrospective follow-up:**
```
Were there any emotional moments or concerns expressed
that I should follow up on privately?
```

---

## Async Standup Support

If your team does async standups (like posting in a channel), Copilot can help:

**Daily synthesis:**
```
Summarize today's async standup updates from the team.
Who has blockers? Who might need help?
```

**Weekly pattern analysis:**
```
Looking at this week's standup posts, what patterns do you see?
Anyone stuck on the same thing multiple days?
```
