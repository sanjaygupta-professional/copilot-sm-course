## Why SharePoint Copilot Matters for SMs

As a Scrum Master, you work with lots of documentation:
- Team wikis and working agreements
- Process documentation and playbooks
- Historical retrospective summaries
- Organizational agile guidelines
- Cross-team coordination documents

SharePoint Copilot helps you:
- Find documents using natural language (not keyword search)
- Get summaries of sites and document libraries
- Discover related content you didn't know existed
- Stay updated on documentation changes

---

## Finding Documents with Natural Language

Instead of keyword searches, ask Copilot naturally.

### Exercise 1: Document Discovery

**In Copilot Chat (with ContextIQ), try:**

```
Find documents related to our team's Definition of Done.
```

```
Where can I find the retrospective notes from last quarter?
```

```
Is there an agile playbook or Scrum guide for Accenture teams?
```

```
Find any documentation about how other teams handle
design dependencies.
```

### What You Should See

Copilot will:
- Search across SharePoint sites you have access to
- Return relevant documents with summaries
- Show where documents are located
- Suggest related content

---

## Summarizing Sites and Libraries

When exploring a new SharePoint site, Copilot can give you the overview.

### Exercise 2: Site Summary

**Navigate to a team SharePoint site and ask:**

```
Summarize what's in this SharePoint site.

I'm looking for:
- Team process documentation
- Meeting notes and decisions
- Templates we use
- Any agile/scrum-related content
```

### What You Should See

A summary of:
- Main document libraries and their purpose
- Key documents and templates
- Recent updates
- How content is organized

---

## Tracking Documentation Updates

Staying current on documentation changes is important.

### Exercise 3: Recent Changes

**Ask Copilot:**

```
What documents in our team SharePoint site have been
updated in the past 2 weeks?

Focus on:
- Process documentation
- Working agreements
- Sprint-related documents
- Any retrospective or ceremony notes
```

### What You Should See

A list of recently modified documents with:
- Document name
- Last modified date
- What changed (if describable)
- Who made the change

---

## Finding Organizational Resources

Your organization likely has agile resources beyond your team.

### Exercise 4: Organizational Discovery

**Ask Copilot to search more broadly:**

```
Search across all SharePoint sites I have access to:

Are there any agile communities of practice, Scrum Master
resources, or coaching materials?

I'm specifically looking for:
- Facilitation guides
- Retrospective templates
- Agile coaching resources
- SM community of practice sites
```

### What You Should See

Resources you might not have known existed:
- Center of Excellence sites
- Community of Practice libraries
- Training materials
- Templates from other teams

---

## Creating and Updating Documentation

Copilot can help you create documentation for SharePoint.

### Exercise 5: Generate Team Wiki Content

**Use Copilot Chat to draft wiki content:**

```
Help me create a wiki page for our team's Scrum ceremonies.

Include sections for:
1. Daily Standup
   - Time and format
   - Who attends
   - What to cover
   - Anti-patterns to avoid

2. Sprint Planning
   - Duration and timing
   - Pre-requisites
   - Agenda
   - Outputs

3. Sprint Review
   - Purpose and attendees
   - Demo format
   - Feedback collection

4. Sprint Retrospective
   - Safe space guidelines
   - Typical formats we use
   - Action item tracking

Format for a SharePoint wiki page with clear headings.
```

### What You Should Get

Ready-to-paste wiki content that you can customize and publish.

---

## Cross-Site Search for SM Topics

### Useful Search Queries

**For process documentation:**
```
Find documentation about how teams handle impediment escalation.
```

**For templates:**
```
Are there sprint planning agenda templates in SharePoint?
```

**For policies:**
```
What are the organizational guidelines for remote work and
meeting schedules?
```

**For learnings:**
```
Find any retrospective summaries or lessons learned from
other product teams.
```

## Pro Tips for SharePoint Copilot

### Better Search Results

1. **Be specific** - "Definition of Done for Velocity Squad" beats "DoD"
2. **Include context** - Mention team names, project names, timeframes
3. **Ask for related content** - "Also find similar documents from other teams"

### For Documentation Creation

1. **Draft in Copilot Chat** - Then copy to SharePoint
2. **Ask for formatting** - Request wiki, table, or list format
3. **Iterate** - "Make this more concise" or "Add more detail to section 2"

### For Staying Current

1. **Set up alerts** - SharePoint can notify you of changes
2. **Periodic checks** - Ask Copilot weekly about updates
3. **Follow sites** - Use SharePoint's follow feature for important sites
