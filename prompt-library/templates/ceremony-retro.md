# Retrospective Templates

Prompts for processing retrospective notes and designing better retros.

## Retrospective Synthesis

Use this to synthesize raw retrospective notes into actionable themes.

```
Synthesize these raw retrospective notes into actionable insights.

Provide:

## THEMES

### What Went Well (Top 3)
For each theme:
- Theme name
- Supporting quotes from the notes
- Why this matters

### What Needs Improvement (Top 3)
For each theme:
- Theme name
- Supporting quotes from the notes
- Frequency (how many people mentioned it)
- Impact on team

### Underlying Patterns
- What connects multiple issues?
- What's the root cause, not just symptoms?
- What's been raised in previous retros?

## RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

For each recommended action:
- Specific, actionable item (not vague)
- Suggested owner
- How to measure success
- Why this will make a difference

Limit to 3 actions maximum - fewer actions, better completion.

## RED FLAGS

Anything in these notes that signals deeper issues:
- Team morale concerns
- Interpersonal tensions
- Systemic organizational problems
- Signs of burnout

## Retrospective Fatigue Analysis

Use this when the team keeps raising the same issues without improvement.

```
Analyze these retrospective notes for signs of "retrospective fatigue" and recurring issues.

I want to understand:

1. **RECURRING THEMES**
   - What issues have been raised multiple times?
   - How many retros have they appeared in?
   - Why haven't they been resolved?

2. **ACTION ITEM COMPLETION**
   - Were previous action items completed?
   - If not, why not?
   - Who was responsible?

3. **TEAM SENTIMENT**
   - Do people sound hopeful or frustrated?
   - Are they proposing new ideas or rehashing old complaints?
   - Is anyone disengaging?

4. **SYSTEMIC BLOCKERS**
   - Which issues are within the team's control?
   - Which require organizational change?
   - What's been escalated? What should be?

5. **FACILITATION OBSERVATIONS**
   - Is the retro format getting stale?
   - Are the same people always talking?
   - Are quieter voices being heard?

Provide recommendations for breaking the cycle.

## Fresh Retrospective Format Generator

Use this when you need a new retro format to combat fatigue.

```
Help me design a fresh retrospective format for my team.

CONTEXT:
- Team size: 7 people
- Sprint length: 2 weeks
- Time available: 1.5 hours
- Remote participants: 1 (different timezone)
- Current state: Retrospective fatigue - same issues, no improvement

WHAT I WANT TO ACHIEVE:
- Generate new perspectives and ideas
- Ensure quieter voices are heard
- Focus on actionable improvements
- Make it energizing, not draining

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must work for hybrid (in-room + remote)
- Must produce concrete actions
- Can't require special supplies (we have Miro)

Provide:
1. **Format name and overview**
2. **Step-by-step facilitation guide with timeboxes**
3. **Specific instructions for including remote participants**
4. **How to handle if the same issues come up again**
5. **Questions to ask that create new thinking**
```

## Individual Retrospective Analysis

Use this to understand what specific team members are saying across retros.

```
Analyze what [team member name] has said across these retrospective notes.

I want to understand:

1. **THEIR MAIN CONCERNS**
   - What themes do they consistently raise?
   - What frustrates them most?
   - What do they celebrate?

2. **THEIR ENGAGEMENT LEVEL**
   - How active are they in retros?
   - Do they propose solutions or just problems?
   - Has their engagement changed over time?

3. **INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS**
   - Do they agree/disagree with specific teammates?
   - Are there tensions visible in their comments?
   - How do others respond to their input?

4. **COACHING OPPORTUNITIES**
   - What might they need support with?
   - What conversation should I (SM) have with them?
   - What would help them thrive?

Be specific with quotes and examples.

## Action Item Accountability Check

Use this to track retrospective action item completion.

```
Help me create an accountability check for our retrospective action items.

From these retro notes, extract all action items with:

| Action Item | Owner | Sprint Assigned | Due By | Status | Notes |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|--------|--------|-------|

Then analyze:

1. **COMPLETION RATE**
   - What percentage of actions were completed?
   - Which sprints had best/worst completion?
   - Are there patterns in what gets done vs. not?

2. **OWNER ANALYSIS**
   - Who completes their actions?
   - Who struggles?
   - Is work distributed fairly?

3. **TYPE ANALYSIS**
   - What types of actions get done? (quick wins, process changes, etc.)
   - What types languish?
   - Are we taking on too much?

4. **RECOMMENDATIONS**
   - How many actions should we take per retro?
   - How do we improve follow-through?
   - What needs to change in how we assign actions?

## Retro Summary for Stakeholders

Use this to create a stakeholder-appropriate summary of retrospective outcomes.

```
Create a brief stakeholder summary of our retrospective outcomes.

I need to share improvement initiatives with leadership without exposing personal team dynamics.

Structure:

## Team Improvement Initiatives - [Sprint]

### What's Working Well
- [2-3 bullet points on team strengths]

### Focus Areas for Improvement
- [2-3 bullet points on process improvements, not people issues]

### Actions We're Taking
- [Concrete actions with expected outcomes]

### Support Needed
- [Any organizational support required]

Keep it professional, positive, and outcome-focused. Don't include:
- Individual complaints
- Interpersonal tensions
- Emotional content
- Anything that makes specific people look bad

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Include full, raw notes** - Even messy notes have valuable signal
2. **Provide historical context** - "This issue has come up 3 times" helps analysis
3. **Ask for root causes** - Don't just summarize, dig into why
4. **Follow up on red flags** - "Tell me more about the morale concerns you identified"
5. **Use to prep, not replace** - Synthesis informs your facilitation, doesn't replace judgment
