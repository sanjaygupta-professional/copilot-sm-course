## Coaching Conversation Prep

Use this to prepare for a 1:1 coaching conversation with a team member.

```
Help me prepare for a coaching conversation with [Name].

CONTEXT:
- Their role: [Role]
- Tenure: [How long on team]
- Situation: [What prompted this conversation]

OBSERVATIONS:
[What I've noticed that I want to discuss]

GOAL:
[What outcome would I like from this conversation]

Help me prepare:

1. **OPENING**
   - How should I start the conversation?
   - How do I create psychological safety?
   - What tone should I set?

2. **POWERFUL QUESTIONS**
   - 5-7 open-ended questions to create awareness
   - Questions that explore, not interrogate
   - Follow-up questions for likely responses

3. **LISTENING POINTS**
   - What should I listen for?
   - What might indicate deeper issues?
   - How do I know if they're being honest?

4. **POTENTIAL PITFALLS**
   - What might make them defensive?
   - What should I avoid saying?
   - How do I stay curious, not judgmental?

5. **CLOSING**
   - How do I end constructively?
   - What commitment or next step?
   - How do I follow up?

Remember: I want to help them discover insights, not lecture them.

## Speaking Up Coaching (for quiet team members)

Use this specifically for coaching someone who struggles to speak up.

```
Help me coach [Name] on speaking up in team meetings.

BACKGROUND:
- They have good ideas in 1:1s but stay silent in groups
- They said in retro: "I feel like my voice doesn't matter"
- They're not confrontational by nature
- They tend to defer to senior team members

I want to help them without:
- Putting them on the spot
- Making them feel broken
- Creating pressure that backfires

Generate:

1. **CONVERSATION OPENER**
   - Non-threatening way to raise the topic
   - Acknowledging their strengths first

2. **EXPLORATORY QUESTIONS**
   - Understanding their experience (not assumptions)
   - What holds them back?
   - What would help?

3. **REFRAMES**
   - Ways to reframe "speaking up" that might resonate
   - Perspectives that might reduce anxiety

4. **PRACTICAL TECHNIQUES**
   - Low-risk ways to start participating more
   - How I can create space for them in meetings
   - Gradual confidence builders

5. **FOLLOW-UP PLAN**
   - How to check in without hovering
   - How to celebrate small wins
   - Timeline for expecting change

Tone: Supportive, patient, recognizing this is hard for them.

## PO Coaching: Stakeholder Management

Use this to coach a Product Owner on managing difficult stakeholders.

```
Help me coach [PO Name] on managing stakeholder expectations.

SITUATION:
- Senior stakeholder ([Stakeholder Name], [Role]) keeps requesting "small additions"
- PO struggles to say no to seniority
- These additions are adding up and affecting sprint commitments
- PO feels caught between stakeholder and team

I want to help the PO:
- Feel empowered to push back
- Have language and techniques to use
- Understand it's okay (and necessary) to say no
- Not feel like they're failing

Generate:

1. **CONVERSATION FRAME**
   - How to position this as support, not criticism
   - Acknowledging the difficulty of their position

2. **SCENARIO EXPLORATION**
   - Questions to understand specific situations
   - When have they successfully said no?
   - What makes this stakeholder particularly hard?

3. **LANGUAGE/SCRIPTS**
   - Ways to say "not now" that feel respectful
   - How to redirect to proper channels
   - Phrases that acknowledge importance while protecting scope

4. **PRACTICE SCENARIOS**
   - Roleplay setup (I'll play the stakeholder)
   - Specific situations to practice

5. **SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS**
   - How can I (SM) support in the moment?
   - What processes might help?
   - When should I intervene vs. let them handle it?
```

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
- [My hypotheses - but I don't want to assume]

GOAL:

- Offer support if needed
- Not make it weird if I'm wrong

Generate:

   - Not "I've been watching you and I'm concerned"
   - Genuine, not clinical

2. **QUESTIONS THAT OPEN DOORS**
   - How to ask "how are you really?" authentically
   - Questions that give permission to share
   - Ways to explore without prying

3. **IF THEY SHARE SOMETHING**
   - How to respond supportively
   - What NOT to say
   - When to just listen vs. offer solutions

4. **IF THEY SAY "I'M FINE"**
   - How to leave the door open
   - Not pushing but not abandoning
   - How to keep an eye without surveillance

5. **BOUNDARIES**
   - What's in scope for me as SM?
   - When to involve HR or other support?
   - How to maintain professional relationship?

Tone: Warm, human, not managerial.
