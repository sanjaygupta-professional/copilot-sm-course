### Your Observations (3 months in)

After 3 months with the team, you've noticed:

1. **Velocity inconsistency** - Swings of 15-20 points sprint to sprint
2. **Retrospective fatigue** - Same issues come up, limited follow-through
3. **Standup inefficiency** - Running 25 minutes instead of 15
4. **Design bottleneck** - David's availability blocks stories regularly
5. **Timezone challenges** - Priya misses informal decisions made in NY

These challenges will be the focus of exercises throughout the course.
